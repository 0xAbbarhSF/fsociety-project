a couple of python scripts and utilities that might be useful 

you can alias in your ~/.bashrc | ~/.zshrc to use them globally

how to do it ?

```
nano ~/.bashrc

alias <utiltiy name>="python3 </location/of/the/script>"

```
if you are old school like me and you are you are using bash, you gonna need to restart the terminal after editing the bashrc file
