i didn't compile them because of the data fields that needs to be filled

i recommend to compile them to stand alone bins with pyinstaller so you don't have to worry about python being installed

how to do it?

write this commands on linux to get an ELF executable or on windows to get EXE executable

- first installing pyinstaller
```
$ python3 -m pip install pyinstaller 
```

- to compile them to be one binary without a bunch of crapy libraries

```
$ pyinstaller <FILE_NAME.py> --onefile
```
